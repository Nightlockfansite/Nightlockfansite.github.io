    <div id="flip3"><h3>Avoxes</h3></div>
    <div id="panel3"><h3>Avoxes</h3>
    <h5>Avoxes are rebels or criminals who'd been punished by the Capitol. They have their tungue cut out, leaving them mute for life. They are used as servants of the tributes and capitol citizens, or to maintain the infrastructure underground. They are only spoken to when given an order, and spend their lives as slaves.</h5>

    <div id="flip2"><h3>Mutants</h3></div>
    <div id="panel2"><h3>Mutants</h3>
    <h5>Mutants, also called mutts are genetically modified creatures made by the capitol. They are known of spying on rebels, and injure them and the tributes in the Games. The most common use though, is killing, often by frightening their target as much as possible, leaving the target unable to defend themselves. Some known mutts are:
    <br><br>
    Jabberjays (see 'mockingjays') 
    <br><br>
    Tracker Jackers<br>
    Tracker jackers were invented during the dark days. They were much bigger than regular wasps, and had a gold-colored body. Nests with tracker jackers were placed around the rebel camps. Their stings raised lumps the size of plums, and the venom could cause hallucinations for days and even death. 
    <br><br>
    Wolf Mutts<br>
    Wolf mutts were created for the 74th Hunger Games, to kill off the last three tributes. All of them resembled the dead tributes, and it looked like the mutts had the tributes eyes. They caught Cato and pained him until Katniss shoot him to end his suffering.
    <br><br>
    Monkey Mutts<br>
    Monkey mutts were made for the third Quarter Quell, as the horror of one section of the clock-arena. They had long claws and teeth, which, if you got bitten, coused internal bleeding. They attacked Katniss, Peeta and Finnick at the first night in the arena, and killed the female morphling from district 6 when she jumped between Peeta and an attacking monkey, saving Peetas life.
    <br><br>
    Lizard Mutts<br>
    Lizard mutts were sent into the underground were squad 451 were travelling towards the City Circle of the Capitol. They had tight pale skin, a reptile-like tale, and they could walk on both four and two legs. When they were searching for Squad 541 they were hissing "Katniss", and they gave a scent like President Snows roses, probably to frighten Katniss. It was possible to kill them, but before Squad 541 figured out how (by making the holo explode att the mutts) the lizard mutts had killed many of Squad 541; Finnick, Castor, Leeg 1, Homes and Jackson.</h5>

    <div id="flip1"><h3>Mockingjays</h3></div>
    <div id="panel1"><h3>Mockingjays<br></h3>
    <h5>In the dark days, the Jabberjays were invented to spie at the rebels. They looked like completely black mockingbirds, but they could memorise whole conversations, and then recite it to the Capitol. This worked a while, until the rebels figured out who was spying on them. The rebels started to spread lies, and when the Capitol didn't have a use for the Jabberjays they trew them out, hoping they would die out. But the male Jabberjays mated with the female mockingbirds, creating a new species; Mockingjays. Beacuse the Capitol didn't mean to create the Mockingjays, the district viewed them as a symbol of the rebellion. When Katniss wore a Mockingjay pin she beacame the symbol of the second rebellion, giving hope to the rebels. </h5>

    <div id="panel">
    <h3>Panem</h3>
    <h5>Panem was the dystopian nation where the story of The Hunger Games took place. It was located in North America, and consisted of thirteen districts and the Capitol;<br><br><br>

    <h4>The Capitol</h4><h5>-An extremely rich city in the middle of Panem, located in the Rocky Mountains.</h5> <br><br>

    <h4>District 1</h4><h5>-A quite wealthy district, producing jewellry. Many careers are from here</h5><br>

    <h4>District 2</h4><h5>-A district located in the Rocky Mountains, not far from the Capitol. Is known for stone work, but it's also where many peacekeepers are trained. A quite wealthy district, and has won the Hunger Games many times. </h5><br>
    <h4>District 3</h4><h5>-Produces technology, and was one of the first districts to join the rebellion during the dark days.</h5> <br>

    <h4>District 4</h4><h5>- A District that produces fish and seafood. It's full of lakes, and everyone in District 4 can swim, which is good in the games. District 4 alsom has a tendence to produce careers.</h5> <br>

    <h4>District 5</h4><h5>-Produces all the power and elecricity in Panem.</h5> <br>

    <h4>District 6</h4><h5>-Not much is said about district 6, but its main industry is transportation.</h5><br>

    <h4>District 7</h4><h5>-District 7 has large areas of forests. The people in district 7 is good with the axe, as their industry is lumber.</h5><br>

    <h4>District 8</h4><h5>-Produces fabric and textiles. District 8 also had a big role in the second rebellion, being the first district to start an uprising.</h5><br>

    <h4>District 9</h4><h5>-Produces grain, and has many factories processing the grain.</h5><br>

    <h4>District 10</h4><h5>-Livestock, produces meat to the Capitol and the rich part of the districts.</h5><br>

    <h4>District 11</h4><h5>-One of the poorest districts in Panem. It's a big and flat district, covered in fields and orchards, as the main industry is agriculture. </h5><br>

    <h4>District 12</h4><h5>-District 12 is one of the smallest and poorest district. Before the second rebellion, its main industry was coal mining, but when the districts had won the war the mines closed and district twelve started to produce medicice.</h5><br>

    <h4>District 13</h4><h5>-After the first uprising district 13 was almost wiped out because of bombings. Those who survived went underground and survived by strict rationing of everything, from food to pencils. The other districts were told that district 13s industry was graphite mining, and even though district thirteen had a small graphite industry, their main industry was nuclear science.</h5><br>

     
     <h5> <br><br>
    The name 'Panem' comes from the latin phrase 'Panem et circenses', or 'Bread and circus', meaning that as long the people had food and entertainment they would't care about the more important things, like equal rights. In this case the 'people' are the Capitol citizens, who watches innocent children die every year in a live sent TV-show, without moving a finger. <br>
    After the second rebellion however, many of the Capitol citizens were executed, and the people in the districts were free to do what they wanted. Finally, Panem was a free country.</h5><br><br></div><br><br>
